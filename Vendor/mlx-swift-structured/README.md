# MLX Structured

[MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift) Structured is a Swift library for structured output generation using constrained decoding. It's built on top of the [XGrammar](https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar) library, which provides efficient, flexible, and portable structured generation. You can learn more about the XGrammar algorithm in their [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15100).

## Installation

To use MLX Structured in your project, add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/petrukha-ivan/mlx-swift-structured", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Don't forget to add the library as a dependency for your targets:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .product(name: "MLXStructured", package: "mlx-swift-structured")
]               
```

## Usage

### Grammar

Start by defining a `Grammar`. You can use JSON Schema to describe the desired output:

```swift
let schema = JSONSchema.object(
    description: "Person info",
    properties: [
        "name": .string(),
        "age": .integer()
    ], required: [
        "name",
        "age"
    ]
)

let grammar = try Grammar.schema(schema)
```

Starting with macOS 26 and iOS 26, you can use a `@Generable` type as a grammar source:

```swift
@Generable
struct PersonInfo: Codable {
    
    @Guide(description: "Person name")
    let name: String
    
    @Guide(description: "Person age")
    let age: Int
}

let grammar = try Grammar.generable(PersonInfo.self)
```

You can also use a regex:

```swift
let regex = #"^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$"# // Simple email regex
let grammar = Grammar.regex(regex)
```

Or define your own grammar rules with [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_form) syntax:

```swift
let ebnf = #"root ::= ("YES" | "NO")"# // Answer only "YES" or "NO"
let grammar = Grammar.ebnf(ebnf)
```

### Complex Grammar

You can define rich, composable grammar rules via a grammar builder. This enables you to describe structured output formats precisely:

```swift
let grammar = try Grammar {
    SequenceFormat {
        ConstTextFormat(text: "Hello!")
        OrFormat {
            JSONSchemaFormat(...)
            RegexFormat(...)
        }
    }
}
```

This can be used in different ways. Here is an example of a constrained Qwen3 tool-calling format:

```swift
let grammar = try Grammar {
    SequenceFormat {
        if forceThinking {
            TagFormat(begin: "<think>", end: "</think>") {
                AnyTextFormat()
            }
        }
        TriggeredTagsFormat(triggers: ["<tool_call>"], options: [.atLeastOne, .stopAfterFirst]) {
            for tool in tools {
                TagFormat(begin: "<tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"\(tool.name)\", \"arguments\": ", end: "}\n</tool_call>") {
                    JSONSchemaFormat(schema: tool.parameters)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Generation

To use a defined grammar during text generation, use the convenient `generate` method. These overloads are fully compatible with MLXLM generation APIs, with the grammar passed as an additional argument:

```swift
let stream = try await generate(
    input: input, 
    context: context, 
    grammar: grammar
)

for await generation in stream {
    switch generation {
    case .chunk(let chunk):
        print(chunk, terminator: "")
    case .toolCall(let toolCall):
        // Handle tool call
    case .info(let info):
        // Handle completion info
    }
}
```

You can also decode constrained JSON output into a `Decodable` type:

```swift
let model = try await generate(
    input: input, 
    context: context, 
    schema: schema,
    generating: PersonInfo.self
)
```

With a `Generable` type, you can generate a validated value directly:

```swift
let model = try await generate(
    input: input, 
    context: context,
    generating: PersonInfo.self
)
```

You can also stream partial `Generable` updates, which return `PartiallyGenerated` content for your type:

```swift
let stream = try await generate(
    input: input, 
    context: context, 
    partially: PersonInfo.self
)

for try await content in stream {
    print("Partially generated:", content)
}
```

You can also create a logit processor manually and pass it to `TokenIterator`:

```swift
let processor = try await GrammarMaskedLogitProcessor.from(configuration: context.configuration, grammar: grammar)
let iterator = try TokenIterator(input: input, model: context.model, processor: processor, sampler: sampler, maxTokens: 256)
```

You can find more usage examples in the `MLXStructuredCLI` target and in the unit tests.

## Experiments

### Performance

In synthetic tests with the Llama model, a simple grammar, and a vocabulary of 60,000 tokens, the performance drop was less than 3%. However, with real models and more complex grammars, the results are slightly worse. In practice, you can expect generation speed to be no more than 10% slower. The exact slowdown depends on the model, vocabulary size, and the complexity of your grammar.

| Model | Vocab Size | Plain (tokens/s) | Constrained (tokens/s) |
| - | - | - | - |
| Qwen3 4B | 151,936 | 100 | 94 (6.0% slower) |
| Qwen3 14B | 151,936 | 33 | 32 (3.0% slower) |
| Llama3.2 1B | 128,256 | 295 | 268 (9.2% slower) |
| Llama3.2 3B | 128,256 | 129 | 119 (7.8% slower) |
| Gemma3 4B | 262,144 | 98 | 92 (6.1% slower) |
| Gemma3 270M | 262,144 | 485 | 444 (8.5% slower) |

### Accuracy

For example, given a task to extract a movie record from text and output it in JSON format, the prompt is:

```plain
Instruction: Extract movie record from the text, output in JSON format according to schema: \(schema)
Text: The Dark Knight (2008) is a superhero crime film directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, and Michael Caine.
```

And the grammar definition looks like this:

```swift
let grammar = try Grammar.schema(.object(
    description: "Movie record",
    properties: [
        "title": .string(),
        "year": .integer(minimum: 1900, maximum: 2026),
        "genres": .array(items: .string(), maxItems: 3),
        "director": .string(),
        "actors": .array(items: .string(), maxItems: 5)
    ], required: [
        "title",
        "year",
        "genres",
        "director",
        "actors"
    ]
))
```

For large proprietary models like ChatGPT, this is not a problem. With the right prompt, they can successfully generate valid JSON even without constrained decoding. However, with smaller models like Gemma3 270M (especially when quantized to 4-bit), the output almost always contains invalid JSON, even if the schema is provided in the prompt.

```plain
[
  "title": "The Dark Knight",
  "actors": [
    "Christian Bale",
    "Heath Ledger",
    "Michael Caine"
  ],
  "genre": "crime",
  "director": "Christopher Nolan",
  "actors": [
    "Christian Bale",
    "Heath Ledger",
    "Michael Caine"
  ],
  "description": "The Dark Knight is a superhero crime film directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Michael Caine."
]
```

This output has several issues:

- Root starts with `[` instead of `{`
- Incorrect key and type for `genres` field
- Missing required `year` field
- Duplicated `actors` field
- Extra `description` field

Here is the output using constrained decoding:

```plain
{
  "title": "The Dark Knight",
  "year": 2008,
  "genres": [
    "superhero",
    "crime"
  ],
  "director": "Christopher Nolan",
  "actors": [
    "Christian Bale",
    "Heath Ledger",
    "Michael Caine"
  ]
}
```

The output is fully valid JSON that exactly matches the provided schema. This shows that, with the right approach, even small models like Gemma3 270M 4-bit (which is just 150 MB) can produce correct structured output.

## Troubleshooting
