/// Incremental parser that converts an LLM answer (with inline
/// `[cite: <uuid>]` markers) into a flat sequence of renderable
/// `AskAnswerSegment` values.
///
/// ## Streaming contract
///
/// Callers pass the *cumulative* answer text after every stream chunk
/// (not deltas). The parser is idempotent: running it on a longer
/// prefix of the same answer produces a superset of the prior result.
/// This decouples the parser from whatever shape the FM streaming API
/// happens to emit (delta vs. snapshot vs. structured chunk).
///
/// ## Tail tolerance
///
/// If the text ends with a partial marker (e.g. `…answer [cite: 4f`),
/// the partial is held back as pending — neither emitted as text nor
/// as a citation — so the user never sees a half-rendered `[cite:` in
/// the streamed answer. Once the closing `]` arrives in a later chunk,
/// the marker is resolved.
///
/// ## Hallucination / placeholder guard
///
/// Markers cite by 1-based index into `orderedIDs` (e.g. `[cite: 3]`).
/// Any marker whose inner text isn't a valid in-range index — an
/// out-of-range number, a stray UUID, or a leftover `TRANSCRIPT_ID`
/// placeholder the model echoed from the prompt — is dropped entirely:
/// both the marker text AND the surrounding bracket are stripped.
/// Dropping silently is better than leaking a raw marker onto the
/// screen or navigating to a transcript that wasn't retrieved.
///
/// ## Citation-tail orphans
///
/// If the stream terminates while a marker is still partial (e.g. user
/// cancelled, model died), the unresolved tail is emitted as plain
/// text via `finalize(...)`. Cosmetic glitch acceptable; rare.
