///     word ends in `.`, `!`, or `?` (after trimming trailing
///     quotes/brackets) → candidate break.

///     sentence-final (same trim) AND the next word (or "and then"
///     two-word phrase) matches a known discourse marker
///     case-insensitively → candidate break.
///   - Safety caps applied to all candidates in ascending order:
///     (1) no break before word 10 of the transcript;
///     (2) no break within 8 words of the previous accepted break.
///   - Any accidental consecutive `\n\n\n\n` is collapsed to `\n\n`.
