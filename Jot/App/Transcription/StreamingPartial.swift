///
/// Bound by `ContentView` to render volatile-then-final dictation text per
/// Apple's HIG (`.secondary` while volatile, `.primary` once batch overrides).

/// `RecordingService.currentSessionID` is the dictation pipeline UUID

/// `adoptSession` / `publishPipelinePhase` — touching it would break v7
/// auto-paste session matching.
///
/// `StreamingPartial.currentSessionID` is a SEPARATE UUID minted per
/// streaming session. It exists solely to drop late partial-transcript
/// callbacks that arrive after `stop()` has already promoted the tail to
/// finalized — without this guard, a late MainActor-queued task would flip
/// `streamingIsVolatile` back to `true` after `.primary` styling has
/// landed. Per dual-model prototype rounds 3-4 verdict.
