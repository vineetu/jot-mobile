/// Process-wide owner of the FluidAudio `StreamingEouAsrManager`
/// (Parakeet EOU 120M @ 320ms) used to drive the live partial-
/// transcript preview during recording. Mirrors the singleton +
/// warm-up + memory-warning shape of `TranscriptionService.shared`.
///
/// ## Two callers
///
/// 1. `JotApp` — eager weights-on-disk check alongside the batch model on
///    first scene activation, gated on (a) setup completed and (b) models
///    on disk (per Guideline 4.2.3(ii) — no silent first-run downloads).
/// 2. `RecordingService.start()` / `stop()` — per-recording session
///    management. `start()` calls `beginSession(presenter:queue:)` to mint
///    a fresh streaming engine + session UUID; `stop()` calls
///    `endSession(engine:)` to fully release CoreML weights per the
///    lifecycle policy below.
///
/// ## Lifecycle policy (cleanup-on-every-stop)
///
/// **Cleanup-on-every-stop, lazy-load-on-every-start.** On stop the
/// FluidAudio manager is fully released via `cleanup()` (per
/// `StreamingEouAsrManager.swift:428-440` — every CoreML reference + cache
/// nil-ed). On next `RecordingService.start()` a fresh manager is
/// instantiated and loaded from disk-cached weights (~200-500ms). The
/// previous "keep-warm" lifecycle (cache the manager across stops) was
/// reverted earlier after on-device testing showed it regressed
/// reliability on the heavier streaming graph that has since been
/// retired. Per-session load is the reliable shape.
///
/// **Memory warning** (`UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification`):
/// no service-level manager exists between sessions, so the hook is mostly
/// a no-op (cancels in-flight prepareTask, clears session UUID). Mid-session
/// manager eviction is the recorder's responsibility — it owns the engine
/// reference for the active session.
///
/// **`warmUp()` is `ensureWeightsOnDisk` — NOT load-into-RAM.** The EOU
/// 320ms weights ship bundled inside the IPA, so `warmUp()` is a presence
/// check; the `.downloading` model state is no longer reachable from this
/// path. `modelState` transitions: `.notLoaded → .ready` once the
/// bundled resources resolve. `.ready` here means "weights cached on
/// disk", NOT "manager loaded into ANE."
///
/// ## warmUp() vs beginSession() vs endSession()
///
/// - `warmUp()` (called by `JotApp.task` + `SetupWizardView`): confirms
///   weights are visible on disk. Disk-only; no ANE load. Idempotent +
///   coalescing.
/// - `beginSession(presenter:queue:)` (called by `RecordingService.start()`):
///   instantiates a NEW `StreamingEouAsrManager`, calls `loadModels(from:)`
///   (~200-500ms ANE load from disk-cached weights), allocates a session
///   UUID, constructs an engine actor, registers the partial callback.
///   Returns the engine.
/// - `endSession(engine:)` (called by `RecordingService.stop()` AFTER the
///   drain task ends and `engine.finish()` runs): calls `engine.cleanup()`
///   which calls `manager.cleanup()` — full release. Recorder drops its
///   reference. Next session re-instantiates from scratch.
///
/// ## Why per-session UUID lives here, not on `RecordingService`
///
/// `RecordingService.currentSessionID` is the dictation pipeline UUID
/// shared cross-process with the keyboard via `PendingPasteSession.id`
/// (auto-paste-v7 territory). The streaming session UUID is a separate
/// concept — it gates partial-transcript callbacks against late MainActor-
/// queued tasks per the prototype rounds-3-4 fix. The two never need to
/// be equal; conflating them would couple unrelated invariants.
