///
/// Two stores, deliberately separate (plan §v2-C):
///   - **proposals (`records`)** — what the gate did, per OCCURRENCE. Each record
///     carries a STABLE identity (`originalStart`, the span's offset in the
///     original pre-rescore text) plus a LIVE anchor (`publishedStart`) into the
///     current transcript text, maintained by `reconciledPayload`/`noteSelfEdit`.
///   - **verdicts** — the owner's `term | original` pick per occurrence, keyed by
///     that stable identity. A verdict HIDES the row (resolved) and drives the
///     this-occurrence text edit. It is the ONLY thing that decides "answered."
///   - **mappingsTaught** — guard so a mapping (`original→term`) feeds the
///     MAPPING-level learning store (`CorrectionStore`) at most once per
///     transcript, regardless of how many occurrences the owner adjudicates.
///     Prevents three "name→Jamy" picks from inflating net to 3.
///
/// Timing (the gate runs BEFORE the transcript id exists): the gate fills a
/// transient `pending` slot at rescore time; `commit(transcriptID:)` moves it to
/// a side-JSON keyed by the real id once the transcript is saved. Dictation is
/// serial → the single pending slot is safe.
