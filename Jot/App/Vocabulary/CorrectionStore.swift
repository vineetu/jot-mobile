/// Safety (review §0j):

///     rare/OOV original arms at net ≥ 1. Deactivation is always net ≤ 0
///     (easy to disarm, hard to arm a dangerous one).
///   - "Confirm a block is correct" adds the pair to a per-term **suppressed**
///     set so the pane stops re-surfacing it (the gate keeps blocking silently).
