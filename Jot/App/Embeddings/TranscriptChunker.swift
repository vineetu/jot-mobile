/// Length-adaptive transcript chunker for RAG ingestion. Pure, synchronous,
/// deterministic — no SwiftData, no ML model, no app state, no `Date()`/random.
/// One whole-transcript string in, an ordered list of `ChunkDraft`s out.
///
/// ## Why chunk at all
///
/// Embedding a whole transcript into one vector is a blurry average — a specific
/// idea inside a 14-minute recording is washed out, and the embedder truncates
/// long input so the tail is never seen at all (see
/// `ask-retrieval-architecture.md` §1–2.A). Splitting into ~256-token windows
/// gives the dense + BM25 retrieval channels something granular to match, and
/// the `charStart`/`charEnd` offsets let a future citation deep-link back to the
/// exact moment in the source text.
///
/// ## Token heuristic (no tokenizer dependency)
///
/// We never load a real tokenizer here — this file stays a pure function. We
/// approximate **~4 characters ≈ 1 token** (English-ish prose, the GPT-family
/// rule of thumb), so `targetTokens * 4` is the target chunk size in characters.
/// The estimate only needs to be good enough to keep chunks inside the embedder's
/// real token window; the embedder re-tokenizes for real downstream.
///
/// ## Algorithm (length-adaptive)
///
/// 1. **Short note → single chunk (the common path).** If the whole text fits in
///    `targetTokens` by the heuristic, return exactly one `ChunkDraft` spanning
///    the whole (whitespace-trimmed) string. Most Jot notes are short, so this is
///    the path that runs almost every time — keep it clean and allocation-light.
/// 2. **Long, punctuated → sentence-aware windows.** Split on `.`/`!`/`?` (the
///    delimiter stays attached to its sentence), then greedily pack sentences into
///    windows of ~`targetTokens`. Each new window re-includes the trailing
///    sentences of the previous one until ~`overlapRatio` of the window size is
///    covered, so adjacent chunks share context and an idea straddling a boundary
///    is not orphaned.
/// 3. **Long, unpunctuated → fixed-character fallback.** A giant run with no
///    sentence boundaries (rare bad transcripts) is split into fixed windows of
///    `targetTokens * 4` characters with the same `overlapRatio` step-back.
///
/// ## Offset contract
///
/// `charStart`/`charEnd` are **Character** offsets (grapheme positions, via
/// `String.Index` distances), *not* UTF-16 / byte offsets, so emoji and combining
/// marks count as one. `String(Array(text)[charStart..<charEnd])` reproduces the
/// *untrimmed* span; the chunk's own `text` is that span with leading/trailing
/// whitespace trimmed, while the offsets are tightened to point at the trimmed
/// span. Windows together cover the whole source — no content is dropped — and no
/// empty chunk is ever emitted.
